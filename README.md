Rule-based Personality Assessment Expert System

The proposed expert system makes use of the strengths of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) system which is to easily classify each person‟s dominant trait and combines it with the strengths of Jung's theories which are to take into account the dynamic nature of people and take into consideration the traits, behavior, habits, and mannerisms of people when assessing personality types. The proposed system was designed to make the user more aware of oneself by showing statements that may describe their mannerism of speaking, their form of communicating ideas, and how they organize their work area to name a few, rather than asking the usual questions that may lead a person on choosing a specific outcome based on the way the questions are structured. However, like most personality assessment tests, the proposed system does not claim to be the guiding principle on how a person should live one‟s life, but only aims to give a snapshot of what a person appears to be for oneself and for others which one can improve on through time.
